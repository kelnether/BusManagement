## 3. Database Design
### Conceptual Design
The system's database includes the following entities and their attributes:
- **Companies**  
  - `id` (Primary Key)  
  - `name`  
  - `website`
- **Bus Route**  
  - `id` (Primary Key)  
  - `line_name`  
  - `company_id` (Foreign Key referencing Companies)
- **Bus Stop**  
  - `id` (Primary Key)  
  - `stop_name`
- **Bus Stop Line**  
  - `line_id` (Foreign Key referencing Bus Route, part of a composite key)  
  - `stop_id` (Foreign Key referencing Bus Stop, part of a composite key)  
  - `sequence` (Indicates the order of stops on a route)
- **Bus Stop Distance**  
  - `id` (Primary Key)  
  - `start_stop_id` (Foreign Key referencing Bus Stop)  
  - `end_stop_id` (Foreign Key referencing Bus Stop)  
  - `distance`
- **Users**  
  - `id` (Primary Key)  
  - `username`  
  - `password`

#### Entity Relationships
- **Companies** and **Bus Route**: One-to-many relationship (one company can manage multiple routes).
- **Bus Route** and **Bus Stop Line**: One-to-many relationship (a route can include multiple stops).
- **Bus Stop** and **Bus Stop Line**: One-to-many relationship (a stop may belong to multiple routes).
- **Bus Stop** and **Bus Stop Distance**: Self-referencing relationship that connects two stops to represent the distance between them.

### Logical and Physical Design
- **Logical Design**: Converts the E-R diagram into relational models, using foreign keys to enforce relationships.
- **Physical Design**:  
  - **Database**: MySQL  
  - **Storage Engine**: InnoDB (to support transactions)  
  - **Character Set**: UTF-8 (to support multiple languages)  
  - **Indexes**: Created on primary keys and frequently queried fields to enhance performance.

> **Example SQL Statements:**
> ```sql
> CREATE DATABASE Bus;
> USE Bus;
> 
> -- Create companies table
> CREATE TABLE companies (
>     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
>     name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
>     website VARCHAR(255)
> );
> 
> -- Create bus_line table
> CREATE TABLE bus_line (
>     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
>     line_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL,
>     company_id INT,
>     FOREIGN KEY (company_id) REFERENCES companies (id)
> );
> 
> -- Create bus_stop table
> CREATE TABLE bus_stop (
>     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
>     stop_name VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL
> );
> 
> -- Create bus_stop_line table
> CREATE TABLE bus_stop_line (
>     line_id INT,
>     stop_id INT,
>     sequence INT,
>     PRIMARY KEY (line_id, stop_id),
>     FOREIGN KEY (line_id) REFERENCES bus_line (id) ON DELETE CASCADE,
>     FOREIGN KEY (stop_id) REFERENCES bus_stop (id) ON DELETE CASCADE
> );
> 
> -- Create bus_stop_distance table
> CREATE TABLE bus_stop_distance (
>     id INT AUTO_INCREMENT PRIMARY KEY,
>     start_stop_id INT,
>     end_stop_id INT,
>     distance DOUBLE,
>     FOREIGN KEY (start_stop_id) REFERENCES bus_stop (id),
>     FOREIGN KEY (end_stop_id) REFERENCES bus_stop (id)
> );
> 
> CREATE DATABASE Users;
> USE Users;
> 
> -- Create users table
> CREATE TABLE users (

>     username VARCHAR(255) NOT NULL UNIQUE,

## 4. System Design
### Architectural Overview
The system is divided into two main parts:
- **Front-End**:  
  Implements the user interface using HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and JSP. It uses Bootstrap along with custom CSS to ensure an attractive and organized layout.
- **Back-End**:  
  Developed in Java with the Spring MVC framework to handle business logic. Data is stored in a MySQL database.
- **Layered Design**:  
  - **Controller**: Handles incoming user requests and delegates tasks to the service layer.  
  - **Service**: Contains business logic such as data validation and processing (CRUD operations).  
  - **DAO (Data Access Object)**: Responsible for interacting with the database by executing SQL statements.  
  - **Model**: Defines the Java classes that correspond to database tables.

## 5. Implementation and Testing
### Core Functionality
- **Transfer Route Algorithm**:  
  - Utilizes Breadth-First Search (BFS) to traverse the bus stop network and find all possible transfer routes.
- **Total Distance Calculation**:  
  - Inspired by Dijkstraâ€™s algorithm, calculates the total distance of each transfer route and sorts the routes by distance.
- **Login Verification and Access Control**:  
  - Ensures that users are authenticated before accessing protected resources by checking login status and redirecting to the login page if needed.

### Testing Strategy
- **Unit Testing**: Each module is tested individually to ensure correct functionality.
- **Integration Testing**: Ensures that the front-end and back-end interact seamlessly and that data is correctly transmitted.
- **User Testing**: Selected users test the system and provide feedback for further improvements.

## 6. Functional Modules and Usage Instructions
### Main Functional Modules
- **User Management**  
  - **Registration**: Users register by providing a username and password.  
  - **Login/Logout**: Upon logging in, users can access system features; unauthenticated users are redirected to the login page.
- **Route Management**  
  - **View Routes**: Displays all bus routes with associated operating companies and stops.  
  - **Add/Edit/Delete Routes**: Provides interfaces for managing routes and assigning operating companies.
- **Stop Management**  
  - **View Stops**: Displays all bus stop information.  
  - **Add/Delete Stops**: Allows administrators to manage bus stops.
- **Company Management**  
  - **View, Add, Edit, Delete Companies**: Manages operating company information.
- **Query Module**  
  - **Route Query**: Enables search by route or stop name with sorting options.  
  - **Transfer Query**: Users input start and end stops to view optimal transfer routes, including the stops along the route and the total distance.

### How to Use the System
1. **Registration and Login**  
   - New users register with a username and password, then log in to access system functions.
2. **Managing Routes**  
   - After logging in, navigate to the route management page to add, edit, or delete routes.
3. **Transfer Query**  
   - On the home or transfer query page, enter the start and end stops to display computed transfer routes sorted by total distance.
4. **Stop and Company Management**  
   - Use the respective management pages to add, modify, or remove bus stops and company details.

## 7. Conclusion
This project demonstrates the design and implementation of a Bus Management Information System that improves the efficiency of managing bus routes, stops, and operating companies while providing a convenient transfer query feature. Built on a robust Java Web architecture (Spring MVC + MySQL), the system is designed for maintainability and scalability. Future enhancements could further optimize transfer algorithms and refine the user interface to meet evolving needs in intelligent public transportation management.
